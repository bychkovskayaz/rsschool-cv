###Briefly about myself
I'm frontend developer based in Minsk. I love my work and I feel that web developement is perfect for me. Because I put every fiber of my soul into projects, I'm ready to go on all night to achieve the goal and see the best result at the end.
I'm student at the moment, but in addition to the university tasks I find free time for self-development (without which it's very difficult, even unreal to work in IT).
I'm open for new projects, because I want to get new skills and improve them.
